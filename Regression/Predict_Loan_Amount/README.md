# Machine_learning Loan Amount Prediction Analysis

This dataset comprises 279,856 loan application records, each with 15 features, including demographic, financial, and employment details of applicants. Key features include age, income, credit score, loan amount, and employment type, among others. The dataset includes both numeric and categorical data, with some missing values in the 'Occupation' column that need addressing.

Our objective is to predict the loan amount using regression analysis. We will prepare the data by handling missing values and selecting relevant features, then train a regression model to estimate loan amounts based on applicant features.
